# Omniutil – Universal Utility Reward Infrastructure

Omniutil is a global infrastructure designed to reward **real user consumption**
within partner ecosystems through a **universal QR-based validation system**
combined with AI-driven approval logic.

It enables ecosystems to transform user activity into transferable utility value.

---

## 🔹 Core Concept

Omniutil connects:
- Real-world consumption
- Digital verification (QR)
- AI validation
- On-chain utility rewards (UTIL)

Each partner ecosystem integrates a **unique Omniutil QR**.
Each scan represents a validated consumption event.

---

## 🔹 Utility Token (UTIL)

The UTIL token represents rewarded utility and can be:

- Transferred between users within the same ecosystem
- Exchanged into USDT
- Redeemed for partner ecosystem services
- Audited on-chain

UTIL is not speculative by design — it is **consumption-backed utility**.

---

## 🔹 Infrastructure Capabilities (Current)

✔ QR generation and validation  
✔ AI approval logic (scripts tested)  
✔ Backend orchestration (Node / TS / C++)  
✔ Smart contract deployed (UTIL)  
✔ User-to-user transfers  
✔ Service redemption logic  
✔ Exchange logic (USDT bridge-ready)  
✔ Partner ecosystem isolation  
✔ Public demo exposure

## 🔹 Architecture Overview

- Backend: Node.js / TypeScript
- Scripts: Automation & validation
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Frontend: Lightweight web interface
- AI Layer: Validation & fraud filtering
- Infrastructure: Self-hosted, tunnel / domain-ready

---

## 🔹 Vision

Omniutil aims to become:
> The universal reward layer for real-world digital consumption.

Any ecosystem.
Any service.
One utility standard.

---

## 🔹 Status

This repository reflects a **functional infrastructure**
with tested scripts and deployed components.

Production scaling, partner onboarding, and public deployment
are the next stages.
